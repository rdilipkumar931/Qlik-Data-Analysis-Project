# Title: Qlik Analysis Of Road Safety And Accident Patterns In India

## Project Description: 
The project aims to utilize Qlik's data analytics platform to analyze road safety and accident patterns in India. By leveraging various data sources, such as traffic data, accident reports, weather conditions, road infrastructure details, and demographic information, the project seeks to identify trends, hotspots, and factors contributing to road accidents. This analysis will help stakeholders, including government authorities, transportation agencies, and road safety organizations, make data-driven decisions to improve road safety measures, reduce accidents, and save lives.

### Key Insight
- Overspeeding is a leading cause of accidents in India, accounting for nearly 70% of road fatalities.
- Using mobile phones while driving or crossing roads is a significant contributor to accidents, as it diverts attention and slows down reflexes. This behavior is prevalent among both drivers and pedestrians.
- A considerable percentage of road users are unaware of or choose to ignore basic traffic rules, such as right-of-way, lane discipline, and using indicators. This ignorance leads to chaotic traffic behavior and accidents.
- Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs remains a serious issue, impairing judgment and reaction time. Despite stringent penalties, enforcement gaps contribute to the persistence of this problem.
- Non-compliance with helmet and seatbelt usage laws leads to higher fatalities and severe injuries during accidents, especially for two-wheeler riders and car occupants.

###Recommendations for Preventing Road Accidents
- Ensure strict enforcement of traffic rules, including penalties for over-speeding, drunk driving, mobile phone usage while driving, and non-compliance with safety gear laws (helmets and seatbelts).
- Increase the deployment of automated systems like speed cameras, red-light cameras, and breath analyzers for consistent monitoring.
- Conduct nationwide campaigns to educate drivers and pedestrians about road safety, traffic rules, and the risks of negligent behavior.
- Promote defensive driving training and refresher courses for drivers, particularly commercial and heavy vehicle drivers.
- Ensure regular vehicle fitness checks and enforce penalties for using poorly maintained or unsafe vehicles.
- Collaborate with private entities for funding road safety initiatives, implementing technology solutions, and organizing awareness programs.
